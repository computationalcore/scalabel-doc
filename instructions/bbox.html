            <h2 id="examples">Bounding Box Annotation Technical Standard</h2>
            <h3>Your Mission</h3>
            <p>Your mission is to annotate bounding boxes around the following
                10 objects as well their attributes (e.g. occluded, truncated,
                color of the traffic light)
                :</p>
            <li>Human: person, rider</li>
            <li>Vehicle: car, truck, bus, train, motor, bike</li>
            <li>Object: traffic sign, traffic light</li>
            <h3><b>Label Categories</b></h3>
            <h4>Person</h4>
            <p>A human that satisfies the following criterion. Assume the human
                moved a distance of 1m and stopped again. If the human would
                walk, the label is person, otherwise not. Examples are people
                walking, standing or sitting on the ground, on a bench, on a
                chair. This class also includes toddlers, someone pushing a
                bicycle or standing next to it with both legs on the same side
                of the bicycle. This class includes anything that is carried by
                the person, e.g. backpack, but not items touching the ground,
                e.g. trolleys.</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/person.png" height="50%" width="50%">
            <h4>Rider</h4>
            <p>A human that would use some device to move a distance of 1m.
                Includes, riders/drivers of bicycle, motorbike, scooter,
                skateboards, horses, roller-blades, wheel-chairs, road cleaning
                cars, cars without roof. Note that a visible driver of a car
                with roof can only be seen through the window. Since holes are
                not labeled, the human is included in the car label.</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/rider.png" height="50%" width="50%">
            <h4>Car</h4>
            <p>Car, jeep, SUV, small van with continuous body shape, caravan,
                no other trailers</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/car.png" height="50%" width="50%">
            <h4>Truck</h4>
            <p>Truck, box truck, pickup truck. Including their trailers. Back
                part / loading area is physically separated from driving
                compartment</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/truck.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Bus</h4>

            <h4>Motor</h4>
            <p> Motorbike, moped, scooter without the driver (that's a rider,
                see above)</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/motor.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Bike</h4>
            <p>Bicycle without the driver (that's a rider, see above)</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/bike.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Traffic Sign</h4>
            <p>Sign installed from the state/city authority, usually for
                information of the driver/cyclist/pedestrian in an everyday
                traffic scene, e.g. traffic- signs, direction signs - without
                their poles. No ads/commercial signs. The front side and back
                side of a sign containing the information. Note that commercial
                signs attached to buildings become building, attached to poles
                or standing on their own become billboard</p>

            <h3><b>Occluded</b></h3>
            <p>An object annotated as "occluded" when one object is
                hidden by another object. e.g. two persons walking
                past each other, or a car that drives under a bridge or parks
                behind another car.</p>
            <p> Good example: annotate all visible parts of the object. </p>
            <img src="image/bbox/good_occluded_example.png" height="40%"
                 width="50%">

                 width="50%">

            <h3><b>Truncated</b></h3>
            <p>An object annotated as `truncated' indicates that the bounding
                box
                specified for the object does not correspond to the full extent
                of the object e.g. an image of a person from the waist up, or a
                view of a car extending outside the image.</p>

                 width="50%">

            <h3><b>Traffic Light Color</b></h3>
            <p> Traffic light object needs to be further annotated with one
                of the following colors: Green, Yellow, Red. Light color of
                other objects are annotated as NA(Not applicable). </p>

            <h2 id="section-1">Draw Box</h2>
            <p>First select the object category from the drop-down menu and
                then perform <b>"click and drag"</b> to draw a bounding box
                around the object. After selecting one category, you can keep
                annotating new objects of the selected category.</p>

            <h2 id="section-2">Edit Box</h2>
            <p> First Select the box by clicking its border or its label tag.
                Selected box will be highlighted when you can resize, remove
                and change the label of the box. You can unselect the box by
                clicking anywhere in the background.

                <li> Adjust Box</li>
            </b>
            <p> Select and drag one of its eight control points.
                Please annotate the bounding box around
                the object as tight as possible and only annotate visible
                part of the object. You can hover on
                one of its eight control points and adjust its shape. </p>
            <b>
                <li> Remove Box</li>
            </b>
            <p> Select and hit the Remove button in the toolbox or pressing
                delete/backspace on keyboard. </p>

            <b>
                <li> Change Label Category</li>
            </b>
            <p> Select and replace its label with a new category option in the
                drop down menu. If you choose a new option in the drop down
                while no bounding box is selected, new bounding boxes will be
                annotated as the new category.

                Numbers below indicate your progress. Start annotating from

                submission.</p>

            <p style="color:red">1. Objects that are smaller than 7 * 7 pixel
                can be ignored. The bounding box smaller than 7 * 7
                will turn grey and disappear when you finish. </p>
            <p>2. Zoom in with your browser to draw the bounding boxes more
                accurately.</p>
            <p>3. Hit "h"(keyboard) to hide category label tags on the bounding
                boxes, and to show them after hitting "h"(keyboard) again. </p>
