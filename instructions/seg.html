            <h3>1. Labeling Policy</h3>
            <p>Labeled foreground objects must never have holes, i.e. if there
                is some background visible 'through' some foreground object, it
                is considered to be part of the foreground. This also applies to
                regions that are highly mixed with two or more classes: they are
                labeled with the foreground class. Examples: tree leaves in
                front of house or sky (everything tree), transparent car windows
                (everything car).
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 Road</h3>
            <p>Roadï¼šPart of ground on which cars usually drive, i.e. all lanes,
                all directions, all streets. Including the markings on the road.
                Areas only delimited by markings from the main road (no texture
                change) are also road, e.g. bicycle lanes, roundabout lanes, or
                parking spaces. This label does not include curbs.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>2.2 Sidewalk</h3>
            <p>Sidewalk: Part of ground designated for pedestrians or cyclists.
                Delimited from the road by some obstacle, e.g. curbs or poles
                (might be small), not only by markings. Often elevated compared
                to the road. Often located at the sides of a road. This label
                includes a possibly delimiting curb, traffic islands (the
                walkable part), or pedestrian zones (where usually cars are not
                allowed to drive during day-time).<br>
                As shown in the second picture below,
                sidewalk in the middle of the road is still sidewalk.</p>
            <br>

                 width="50%"></img>


            <br>
            <h3>2.3 Parking</h3>
            <p>Parking lots and driveways. Not for regular driving, but rather
                to park a vehicle. Different texture than road. In ambiguous
                cases where the driveway is not separated from the sidewalk
                (e.g. a building entrance), labeled as sidewalk.</p>
            <br>

            <img src="image/seg/parking1.png" height="200px"
                 width="300px"></img><img src="image/seg/parking2.png"

            <p>The second image should be considered sidewalk.</p>
            <h3>2.4 Rail Track</h3>
            <p>All kind of rail tracks that are non-drivable by cars, e.g.
                subway and train rail tracks, while tram rail tracks are usually
                drivable by cars and therefore part of road.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>2.5 Person</h3>
            <p>A human that satisfies the following criterion. Assume the human
                moved a distance of 1m and stopped again. If the human would
                walk, the label is person, otherwise not. Examples are people
                walking, standing or sitting on the ground, on a bench, on a
                chair. This class also includes toddlers, someone pushing a
                bicycle or standing next to it with both legs on the same side
                of the bicycle. This class includes anything that is carried by
                the person, e.g. backpack, but not items touching the ground,
                e.g. trolleys.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>2.6 Rider</h3>
            <p>A human that would use some device to move a distance of 1m.
                Includes, riders/drivers of bicycle, motorbike, scooter,
                skateboards, horses, roller-blades, wheel-chairs, road cleaning
                cars, cars without roof. Note that a visible driver of a car
                with roof can only be seen through the window. Since holes are
                not labeled, the human is included in the car label.</p>
            <h3>2.8 Truck</h3>
            <p>Truck, box truck, pickup truck. Including their trailers. Back
                part / loading area is physically separated from driving
                compartment.</p>
            <h3>2.9 Bus</h3>
            <p>Bus for 9+ persons, public transport or long distance
                transport.</p>
            <h3>2.10 On Rails</h3>
            <p>Vehicle on rails, e.g. tram, train.</p>

            <h3>2.11 Motorcycle</h3>
            <p>Motorbike, moped, scooter without the driver (that's a rider,
                see above).</p>

            <img src="image/seg/motor1.png" height="200px"

            <h3>2.13 Caravan</h3>
            <p>Like truck, but back is primarily for living/sleeping.
                Including caravan trailers.</p>

            <img src="image/seg/caravan.png" height="50%"
                 width="50%"></img>

            <h3>2.14 Trailers</h3>
            <p>Trailers typically pulled by cars. Note that truck trailers
                are labeled truck, caravan trailers caravan, bicycle or horse
                trailers dynamic.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In the first image: the trailer is towed by car, so it's
                trailer. The second one should be labeled as truck.</p>
            <br>

            <img src="image/seg/trailer3.png" height="200px"

            <p>Horse trailer and bicycle trailer: dynamic.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>2.15 Building</h3>
            <p>Building, skyscraper, house, bus stop building, garage, car port.
                If a building has a glass wall that you can see through, the
                wall is still building. Includes scaffolding attached to
                buildings.</p>
            <h3>2.16 Wall</h3>
            <p>Individual standing wall. Not part of a building.</p>
            <h3>2.17 Fence</h3>
            <p>Fence including any holes.</p>
            <h3>2.18 Guard Rail</h3>
            <p>All types of guard rails/crash barriers.</p>
            <h3>2.19 Bridge</h3>
            <p>Only the bridge. Fences, people or vehicles on top are labeled
                separately.</p>
            <h3>2.20 Tunnel</h3>
            <p>Tunnel wall and 'the dark'. No vehicles.</p>
            <h3>2.21 Garage</h3>

            <img src="image/seg/garage1.png" height="200px"
                 width="300px"></img><img src="image/seg/garage2.png" height="200px"
                                          width="300px"></img>

            <h3>2.22 Pole</h3>
            <p>Small mainly vertically oriented pole. E.g. sign pole, traffic
                light poles. If the pole has a horizontal part (often for
                traffic light poles) this part is also considered pole. If there
                are things mounted at the pole that are neither traffic light
                nor traffic sign (e.g. street lights) and that have a diameter
                (in pixels) of at most twice the diameter of the pole, then
                these things might also be labeled pole. If they are larger,
                they are labeled static.</p>
            <h3>2.23 Pole Group</h3>
            <p>Multiple poles that are cumbersome to label individually. This
                label is ok to use, if the gap between two poles has at most as
                many pixels width as a single pole.</p>
            <h3>2.24 Traffic Sign</h3>
            <p>Sign installed from the state/city authority, usually for
                information of the driver/cyclist/pedestrian in an everyday
                traffic scene, e.g. traffic- signs, direction signs - without
                their poles. No ads/commercial signs. The front side and back
                side of a sign containing the information. Note that commercial
                signs attached to buildings become building, attached to poles
                or standing on their own become billboard.</p>

            <h3>2.25 Traffic Light</h3>
            <p>The traffic light box without its poles.</p>
            <h3>2.26 Banner</h3>

            <h3>2.28 Street Light</h3>

            <h3>2.34 Vegetation</h3>
            <p>Tree, hedge, all kinds of vertical vegetation. Plants attached to
                buildings are usually not annotated separately and labeled
                building as well. If growing at the side of a wall or building,
                marked as vegetation if it covers a substantial part of the
                surface (more than 20%).</p>
            <h3>2.35 Terrain</h3>
            <p>Grass, all kinds of horizontal vegetation, soil or sand. These
                areas are not meant to be driven on. This label includes a
                possibly delimiting curb. Single grass stalks do not need to be
                annotated and get the label of the region they are growing
                on.</p>

            <h3>2.37 Ground</h3>
            <p>All other forms of horizontal ground-level structures that do not
                match any of the above. For example areas that cars and
                pedestrians share all-day, roundabouts that are flat but
                delimited from the road by a curb, elevated parts of traffic
                islands, water. Void label for flat areas.</p>
            <h3>2.38 Dynamic</h3>
            <p>Things that might not be there anymore the next day/hour/minute:
                Movable trash bin, buggy, bag, wheelchair, animal.</p>
            <h3>2.39 Static</h3>
            <p>Clutter in the background that is not distinguishable. Objects
                that do not match any of the above. For example, visible parts
                of the ego vehicle, mountains, street lights. Also rather small
                regions in the image that are some of the classes above, but
                that are cumbersome to label precisely might be annotated
                static.</p>
            <h3>2.40 Bus Stop</h3>
            <p>A bus stop is a designated place where buses stop for passengers

            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>3.1 Single instance annotations are available. However, if the
                boundary between such instances cannot be clearly seen, the
                whole crowd/group is labeled together and annotated as group,
                e.g. car group.</p>
            <p>3.2 This label is not included in any evaluation and treated as
                void (or in the case of license plate as the vehicle mounted
                on).</p>
            <p>3.3 Objects that are smaller than 50X50 pixel can be ignored.</p>

            <br>
            <p>2. When you finish your task, click the
                button "Submit" on top right and your submission will be
                stored.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Click "Hide Label" button (or press "L(l)") in the control box
                to hide
                categories of regions. Click/press it again to show.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4. Select an annotated region by <b><u>Double Click</u></b>,
                and <b><u>Double Click</u></b> the background image to cancel
                selection.
                You can change the selection by double click other region.
                Once a region is selected, you can change its category,
                resize or delete.
                <b><u>DO NOT USE SINGLE CLICK TO SELECT</u></b>, or you will
                draw a new region.</p>
            <br>
            <p>5. Move your mouse onto a vertex, <b><u>when it turns bigger and
                green</u></b>, then press "ESC" or "DELETE" to delete a vertex.
                Otherwise, the deletion is invalid. You can also press "ESC" to
                remove the whole object that you are drawing, and use
                "DELETE" to remove a latest vertex.</p>
            <br>
            <p>6. Clicking "Magnify" Button (or press "M(m)"), you can annotate
                small regions with the help of a magnifier. Click (press) again
                to remove it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>7. Move your mouse onto a midpoint of one straight edge, <b><u>when
                it turns bigger and orange</u></b>, press "B(b)" to change this
                edge to a Bezier Curve. You can drag the control points to
                adjust its shape.</p>
            <br>
            <p>8. If points are too dense and annoying, press "H(h)" to hide
                midpoints when hovering on a region.</p>
            <br>
            <p>9. Click "+/-" or press PageUp/PageDown to zoom.</p>
            <br>
            <p>10. If an object is separated by others, use "Link" button to
                link these regions, so that they can have the same instance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>11. If you want to obtain part of the border of an
                existed object, press "S/s" when drawing or before drawing, and
                then click
                two endpoints on the border. After that, you can continue
                drawing and clicking. Thus the object
                can share border with what you are drawing. It's less time
                consuming.</p>
            <hr>

            <h2 id="section-2">Draw Polygon</h2>
            <p>1. You can draw a polygon using many single
                clicks. The positions of your clicks
                form the vertices. </p>
            <br>
            <p>2. When you want to finish drawing, move your mouse to the first
                vertex (where you started). You will notice the it becomes green
                and bigger, then make a click right there and a close path will
                be formed.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="section-3">Resize and Add New Vertex</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>Resize</h3>
            <p>1. You can drag vertices to resize a region's shape. When you
                move your mouse onto a
                vertex, it will turn green and bigger. If your mouse leaves, it
                will recover. <b>So try not to move
                    your mouse after seeing this phenomenon.</b></p>
            <br>
            <p>2. Make a click on "the big green vertex" but keep your
                mouse down; and then drag the vertex to where you
                want.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Add Vertex</h3>
            <br>
            <p>1. When you hover onto a region, some other points (not only the
                vertices) are shown. They are midpoints. We will use
                midpoints to support some operations related to edges.</p>
            <br>
            <p>2. When you hover onto a midpoint, it
                will be orange and bigger. </p>
            <br>
            <p>3. Make a click right on the "big orange midpoint", and
                drag the midpoint somewhere you want. It will
                become a new vertex, and create another 2 new
                midpoints. In this way you can add a vertex between
                any two vertices.</p>

            <p> 1. Hover onto the <b>midpoint</b> of the edge
                you want to change. Then press <b>"B"</b> or <b>"b"</b>,
                a cubic Bezier curve will be created.

            <p>2. But it's ok if you don't know anything about it.
                Your pressing will create a Bezier curve with 4 Bezier
                control points, they are in yellow:
                two endpoints of the edge and two new
                points between them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>3. You can hover on and drag these "Bezier control points"
                to change the shape of
                the curve. So that you can use it to annotate
                curves, such as curved lane.</p>
            <br>
            <p>4. Hover onto a "Bezier control point" and

                you can also see the vertices of other objects when moving
                your mouse onto them. That means you have entered the "quick
                draw" mode. Meanwhile, the toolbox will become blue. It will
                remain blue or green unless you exit the "quick draw" mode. (By
                press
                "S/s" again).</p>
            <p>3. Select two vertices on the border by clicking. <b>After
                your first click, the toolbox will turn green, and the
                object you selected will change color.</b> After your second
                click, the toolbox will change from green to blue. You can
                see a polyline is formed.
            <p>4. You can use "PageLeft/PageRight" to choose the border,
                because there are two cases: clockwise or counter-clockwise.</p>
            <p>5. The toolbox will remain green before you click a pair of
                points on the same object. And when you click on a new
                object, it will remain green, since no coincide
                border is formed, so that you can continue finding its pair.</p>
            <p>6. Click the background image, the toolbox will be blue. So
                in conclude, color green means you have finished the first
                click and should look for the second point; color blue means
                your should look for the first point.</p>
            <p>7. The same as ordinary draw mode, press "delete" to delete
                the latest vertex or last added border,
                and press "esc" to delete the whole object. And when a closed
                path is formed, your annotation is finished.
            <p>8. <b>You can use it to click anywhere like the ordinary draw
                mode, it only provides function to draw coincide part quickly by
                clicking twice.</b></p>

            <p>Here is a video on how to draw:</p>

            <p>You must press "S/s" to enter/exit the "quick draw" mode
                (unless the close path has been formed). In "quick draw"
                mode, the poly will no longer be filled. And in ordinary draw
                mode, the vertices of other region are invisible.

            <h2 id="section-8">What's more:</h2>
            <p>1. Remember, the delete operation is irreversible.</p>
            <p>2. You can not delete a midpoint (that's a ridiculous
                opration).</p>
            <p>3. If you press "ESC" when your mouse is on a Bezier control
                point, the curve will recover to a straight edge.</p>
            <p>4. The operations related with point are valid if and only if its<b>
                shape changes.</b></p>
            <p>5. If you want to drag some vertices occluded,
                you can select the region and do that.</p>
