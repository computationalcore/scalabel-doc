            <h2 id="examples">Bounding Box Tracking Annotation Technical Standard</h2>
            <h3>Your Mission</h3>
            <p>Your mission is to annotate bounding box tracks around the following
                10 objects as well their attributes (e.g. occluded, truncated)
                :</p>
            <li>Human: person, rider</li>
            <li>Vehicle: car, truck, bus, train, motor, bike</li>
            <h3><b>Label Categories</b></h3>
            <h4>Person</h4>
            <p>A human that satisfies the following criterion. Assume the human
                moved a distance of 1m and stopped again. If the human would
                walk, the label is person, otherwise not. Examples are people
                walking, standing or sitting on the ground, on a bench, on a
                chair. This class also includes toddlers, someone pushing a
                bicycle or standing next to it with both legs on the same side
                of the bicycle. This class includes anything that is carried by
                the person, e.g. backpack, but not items touching the ground,
                e.g. trolleys.</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/person.png" height="50%" width="50%">
            <h4>Rider</h4>
            <p>A human that would use some device to move a distance of 1m.
                Includes, riders/drivers of bicycle, motorbike, scooter,
                skateboards, horses, roller-blades, wheel-chairs, road cleaning
                cars, cars without roof. Note that a visible driver of a car
                with roof can only be seen through the window. Since holes are
                not labeled, the human is included in the car label.</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/rider.png" height="50%" width="50%">
            <h4>Car</h4>
            <p>Car, jeep, SUV, small van with continuous body shape, caravan,
                no other trailers</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/car.png" height="50%" width="50%">
            <h4>Truck</h4>
            <p>Truck, box truck, pickup truck. Including their trailers. Back
                part / loading area is physically separated from driving
                compartment</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/truck.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Bus</h4>
            <p>Bus for 9+ persons, public transport or long distance
                transport.</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/bus.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Train</h4>
            <img src="image/bbox/train.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Motor</h4>
            <p> Motorbike, moped, scooter without the driver (that's a rider,
                see above)</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/motor.png" height="10%" width="10%">
            <h4>Bike</h4>
            <p>Bicycle without the driver (that's a rider, see above)</p>
            <img src="image/bbox/bike.png" height="10%" width="10%">

            <h3><b>Occluded</b></h3>
            <p>An object annotated as "occluded" when one object is
                hidden by another object. e.g. two persons walking
                past each other, or a car that drives under a bridge or parks
                behind another car.</p>
            <p> Good example: annotate all visible parts of the object. </p>
            <img src="image/bbox/good_occluded_example.png" height="40%"
                 width="50%">
            <p> Bad example: missed some visible parts of the object. </p>
            <img src="image/bbox/bad_occluded_example.png" height="40%"
                 width="50%">

            <h3><b>Truncated</b></h3>
            <p>An object annotated as `truncated' indicates that the bounding
                box
                specified for the object does not correspond to the full extent
                of the object e.g. an image of a person from the waist up, or a
                view of a car extending outside the image.</p>

            <h2 id="section-1">Draw Box</h2>
            <p>First select the object category from the drop-down menu and
                then perform <b>"click and drag"</b> to draw a bounding box
                around the object. After selecting one category, you can keep
                annotating new objects of the selected category.</p>

            <h2 id="section-2">Edit Box</h2>
            <p> First Select the box by clicking its border or its label tag.
                Selected box will be highlighted when you can resize, remove
                and change the label of the box. You can unselect the box by
                clicking anywhere in the background.
            </p>
            <b>
                <li> Adjust Box</li>
            </b>
            <p> Select and drag one of its eight control points.
                Please annotate the bounding box around
                the object as tight as possible and only annotate visible
                part of the object. You can hover on
                one of its eight control points and adjust its shape. </p>
            <b>
                <li> Remove Box</li>
            </b>
            <p> Select and hit the Remove button in the toolbox or pressing
                delete/backspace on keyboard. </p>

            <b>
                <li> Change Label Category</li>
            </b>
            <p> Select and replace its label with a new category option in the
                drop down menu. If you choose a new option in the drop down
                while no bounding box is selected, new bounding boxes will be
                annotated as the new category.

            <p>Create a bounding box at the first frame it appears, and adjust the bounding boxes in the subsequent frames. For a given bounding box track, the frames in which the box is edited are considered a keyframe. The frames between keyframes are automatically interpolated.</p>

            <p>For an object that disappears after certain frame, click “End Object Track” or press Ctrl-E (Cmd-E for Mac users) at the frame of its last occurrence. The bounding box labels after this frame will be deleted.</p>

            <h2 id="section-linking">Track linking</h2>
            <p>Sometimes an object reappears in the frame due to occlusion or re-entrance, and track linking enables individual tracks to be linked as a single instance. Select a label, click “Track-Link” or press Ctrl-L (Cmd-L for Mac users), and click on any other tracks that you want to link with this label. The tracks you choose to link appears in dashed lines. Click “Finish Track-Link” or hit Enter to finish this operation.</p>

            <h2 id="section-3">Submit Assignment</h2>
            <p> When you reach the last image, you can submit
                the assignment by hitting the submit button.
                Numbers below indicate your progress. Start annotating from
                the first image, and finish the whole assignment before
                submission.</p>

            </div>
            <h2 id="section-4">What's More</h2>
            <p style="color:red">1. Objects that are smaller than 7 * 7 pixel
                can be ignored. The bounding box smaller than 7 * 7
                will turn grey and disappear when you finish. </p>
            <p>2. Toggle the keyboard usage window by pressing '?'. Being familiar with the keyboard shortcuts can make labeling much more efficient.</p> 
            <p>3. Zoom in with your browser to draw the bounding boxes more
                accurately. You can zoom in by pressing the '+'/'-' keys or scroll while pressing Ctrl (Cmd for Mac users). When zoomed in, you can drag the image around when pressing Ctrl (Cmd for Mac users).</p>
            <p>3. Hit "h"(keyboard) to hide category label tags on the bounding
                boxes, and to show them after hitting "h"(keyboard) again. Press the up/down arrow keys to bring a selected label forward/backward, and press the 'f'/'b' buttons to bring a selected label to front/back. </p>
            <p>4. The remove operation is irreversible.</p>
            <p>5. If you refresh the page before submission, all previous
                history will not be saved.
