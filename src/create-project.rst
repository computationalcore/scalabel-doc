The interface of creating a new project is shown as following. We use
the video bounding box annotation as an example.

In this case, you need to upload ``image_list.yml`` which contains
either paths to the video frames or public readable urls to the frames
in the ``Item List``. For ``Categories`` and ``Attributes``, you can
upload the yaml files that contain the labels and attribute descriptions
respectively. Please refer to ``examples/`` folder for more details.

At this point, you can click ``Go to Dashboard`` to monitor the project,
download results and try the annotation tool. The interface is shown as
follows.
